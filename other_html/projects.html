                    <h4>Project 1</h4>
                    <p>I designed a game called "Witchwood Cottage" for our game club, a fun but competitive strategy game set in a magical forest. 
                        Players take on the role of apprentice witches, each living in their own enchanted cottage, 
                        racing to brew three powerful potions and win the approval of the head witch. 
                        The forest is built from modular tiles that change with every game, and players explore it to gather rare ingredients 
                        like ghost mushrooms and phoenix feathers. There’s a mix of trading, spellcasting, and just enough sabotage to keep things interesting. 
                        I came up with the original concept and core mechanics, and then worked with my team to bring it all together. 
                        One teammate focused on visuals and card design, while another helped refine the rulebook and balance the gameplay through testing. 
                        We spent a lot of time playtesting, making sure every decision felt meaningful and that the game stayed fun even when things got a little chaotic. 
                        It was a really collaborative process, and we’re proud of how it turned out something magical, strategic, and full of personality.</p>

                    <h4>Project 2</h4>
                    <p>I was part of a team that designed and built an autonomous robot, where I led the programming and software integration efforts. 
                        The objective was to develop a robot capable of navigating dynamic environments, detecting and responding to obstacles, 
                        and executing task specific behaviors both autonomously and under manual control. My responsibilities included writing 
                        control algorithms, implementing sensor fusion using ultrasonic sensors and encoders, and integrating computer vision through 
                        a camera module. I developed a modular and scalable codebase, enabling real time decision making and smooth coordination between 
                        hardware components. Collaboration with the hardware and electronics teams was essential, and we worked closely to test, debug, and 
                        iterate on the full system. This project deepened my understanding of embedded systems, real time programming, 
                        and the importance of cross disciplinary teamwork in robotics development.
